This directory contains information about how to
access DNS zone data for the different top-level
domains (TLDs).

The Root Zone (.)
=================

https://www.iana.org/domains/root/files

```
dig +noall +answer +noidnout +onesoa @f.root-servers.net . AXFR
```

Infrastructure domain (arpa.)
=============================

Available via AXFR:

```
dig +noall +answer +noidnout +onesoa @$(dig +short ns arpa. | head -1) arpa AXFR
```

Original Top-Level Domains (TLDs)
=================================

edu.
----

Per inquiry to https://www.educause.edu/, the zone is
only made available "_when the proposed use of the
zone file directly contributes to the security of the
domain_."

Inquiries should be sent to edu@educause.edu.

mil.
----

Per inquiry to the technical contact listed in WHOIS,
the data for `mil.` is not made available.


Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs)
=================================

DNS zone data is available for the generic TLDs per
ICANN requirements via their Centralized Zone Data
Service at https://czds.icann.org/.

Most gTLD operators provide this data without much
push back. Some gTLD operators require you to submit
an explanation of why you require access, others
require you to submit some personal information (e.g.,
contact information, postal address, associated IP
addresses), and [yet
others](https://mstdn.social/@jschauma/110306237694079456)
ask to see your ID.

Sponsored Top-Level Domains (sTLDs)
===================================

International (int.)
--------------------

Per inquiry to tld-contact@iana.org, the zone for
`int.` is not available to the public.



Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs)
=======================================

make zone data available to the public.  When
contacted, most ccTLD operators deny the request.
